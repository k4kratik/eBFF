# eBFF - your well wisher at work

## What it does
In our slack workspace, we have one channel where everyone post updates about their availabilities. You need to create a bot user and tag this bot in that thread where someone posted about their unavailability. This app will fetch that update and will reply with a take care message with some home remedies if the OP is not feeling well.

## Setup
